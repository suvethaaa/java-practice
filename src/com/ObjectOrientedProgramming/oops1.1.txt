The 'this' Keyword:

Sometimes a method will need to refer to the object that invoked it. To allow this, Java defines the this keyword.

this can be used inside any method to refer to the current object. That is, this is always a reference to the object on

which the method was invoked.

why not using new keyword in primitive data types :

       they do not use objects , the values are objects itself

       why ? efficiency
