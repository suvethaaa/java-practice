problem we might face :

consider the maze problem now we can go in all four direction and also diagonal

if we run the recursion as we did in the previous program it will end up as stack overflow since we come to the
same point again and again

how to solve ? if you do not want to visit the cell already then do not allow to visit the cell, so mark the cells
as false so it does not go there

so when a single recursion call or the stacked calls occurs it changes the boolean array hence to check the
another coordinates path  need to change the array as it is initialized in the beginning

when you go outside the recursion calls the changes made by those recursion calls should be removed or not available

change the changes you made previously
