problem we might face :

consider the maze problem now we can go in all four direction and also diagonal

if we run the recursion as we did in the previous program it will end up as stack overflow since we come to the
same point again and again

how to solve ? if you do not want to visit the cell already then do not allow to visit the cell, so mark the cells
as false so it does not go there
