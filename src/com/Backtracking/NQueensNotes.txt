Given an n and we have to place n queens in the n x n chess board

how do we know it is recursion ?

    the problem is split into small problems by finding place for each queen from the starting row ,
    and further placing another by checking whether the previously placed queens attacking it and further.

how does it come under backtracking ? (changing the changes done via a recursion call while its returning)

    when there is no possible way to place a queen so there would be a wrong placement of queens in the previous
    steps hence backtrack by removing the lastly placed queens and checking for another possibilities  that all
    queens will be placed .
    note : consider every single possibility.

how do we do ?
